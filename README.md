  The data file is provided in Tecplot format and includes four columns: hub-height sectional positions X/D and Y/D, time-averaged velocity, and turbulence intensity. The files can be directly opened using Tecplot. Additionally, the Tecplot script files TI.lay and Ux.lay allow for direct visualization of turbulence intensity and mean velocity.
